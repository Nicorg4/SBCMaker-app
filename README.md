# FIFA Ultimate Team SBC Solver

This is a Python application project that provides an interface to solve Squad Building Challenges (SBCs) in FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) game mode.

## Description

FIFA Ultimate Team is a game mode within the popular FIFA video game by EA Sports. One of its components is the Squad Building Challenges (SBC), where players must build teams that meet certain criteria, such as having certain player ratings in the team.

This application offers a way to search for solutions to SBC challenges. Users can input a series of parameters, such as player ratings available, desired team rating, and search type (precise or flexible), and the application will return a list of possible solutions that meet those criteria.

## How It Works

The application is developed in Python and uses the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can input the ratings of available players, the desired team rating, define the player rating range, and select the search type (precise or flexible).

Once all the required data is entered, the application will display a list of found solutions that meet the specified criteria.
